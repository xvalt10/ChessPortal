	/**
	 * The following rules are valid for each Swiss system unless explicitly stated
	 * otherwise.
	 * 
	 * The number of rounds to be played is declared beforehand.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Two players shall not play against each other more than once.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Should the number of players to be paired be odd, one player is unpaired.
	 * This player receives a pairing-allocated bye: no opponent, no colour and as
	 * many points as are rewarded for a win, unless the rules of the tournament
	 * state otherwise.
	 * 
	 * d
	 * 
	 * 
	 * A player who has already received a pairing-allocated bye, or has already
	 * scored a (forfeit) win due to an opponent not appearing in time, shall not
	 * receive the pairing-allocated bye.
	 * 
	 * e
	 * 
	 * 
	 * In general, players are paired to others with the same score.
	 * 
	 * f
	 * 
	 * 
	 * For each player the difference between the number of black and the number of
	 * white games shall not be greater than 2 or less than â€“2. Each system may have
	 * exceptions to this rule in the last round of a tournament.
	 * 
	 * g
	 * 
	 * 
	 * No player shall receive the same colour three times in a row. Each system may
	 * have exceptions to this rule in the last round of a tournament.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * In general, a player is given the colour with which he played less games.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * If colours are already balanced, then, in general, the player is given the
	 * colour that alternates from the last one with which he played.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * The pairing rules must be such transparent that the person who is in charge
	 * for the pairing can explain them.
	 * 
	 * At any stage in the tournament you have to have a list of forbidden pairings.
	 * 
	 * The first, obvious entries are pairings that have occurred previously. The
	 * second, banning 3 whites in a row, is ww v ww since one of them will have to
	 * be white giving www. Similarly bb v bb is forbidden. Then the white/black
	 * imbalance, so 2 v 2 and -2 v -2 are forbidden since in each case one player
	 * will end up with a 3 or -3 imbalance.
	 * 
	 * So, for each player you need to keep track of previous opponents, colour
	 * sequence and colour imbalance. This gives you the information to know which
	 * pairings are forbidden. In the last round you should also perform the
	 * forbidden pairing check for colours and pair with this in mind if possible.
	 * If not then you can ignore colour restrictions in the last round only.
	 * 
	 * The "previous opponent" forbidden pairings are cumulative. The "colour"
	 * forbidden pairings change from round to round as the players' colour
	 * sequences and imbalances change.
	 *
